### Pipeline as Code
I designed and maintained enterprise-grade **25+ stage CI/CD pipelines** to automate microservices deployments.

- **Automation**: Developed **Python-based scripts** that reduced manual execution time by ~40% (from 7 hours down to 3).
- **Standardization**: Used IaC and configuration management to standardize release validation, cutting manual effort by ~60%.
- **Observability**: Integrated **Prometheus** and **Grafana** into the pipeline to export infrastructure KPIs into Jenkins-archived artifacts for benchmarking.
