### Container Strategy & Optimization
At Manhattan Associates, I leveraged Docker to standardize environments and streamline the deployment of microservices.

- **Multi-Stage Builds**: Implemented multi-stage Dockerfiles to minimize image footprints, improving security and deployment speed.
- **Environment Parity**: Ensured consistency between local development and GKE production clusters by containerizing complex dependencies.
- **Troubleshooting**: Performed deep-level debugging of container lifecycles and runtime logs to resolve performance bottlenecks.
