### Google Kubernetes Engine Operations
I managed production-grade **GKE clusters** to support high-volume warehouse management software runs.

- **Cluster Management**: Managed node pools and auto-scaling configurations to handle variable workloads during peak shipment periods.
- **Defect Reduction**: Drove performance-related defects from ~18 to **zero** through meticulous pod and resource optimization.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Operationalized platform-driven prescaling workflows, significantly reducing cold-start delays by **40%+**.
