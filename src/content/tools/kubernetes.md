### Infrastructure at Scale
At Manhattan Associates, I specialized in production **GKE cluster management**, ensuring high availability for critical microservices.

- **Scale**: Executed and stabilized ~60 high-volume **Wayfair E2E runs**, handling 2K-4K shipments per run.
- **Troubleshooting**: Used `kubectl` for deep-level debugging of pod states, container logs, and ingress routing.
- **Efficiency**: Operationalized platform-driven prescaling, reducing cold-start delays by over 40%.
- **Impact**: Drove recurring performance defects from ~18 to **zero** prior to customer go-live.
